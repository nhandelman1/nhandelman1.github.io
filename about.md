### Career Goals

#### Short Version

I am seeking employment as an entry-mid level quantitative developer, quantitative analyst, software engineer or related role at a firm in the investing, banking or wider financial industry. These roles all combine software development, mathematics, finance and a challenging environment into one package. Considering my experience and education, I believe my best fit role is as a developer of full stack software tools, where an ability to understand and implement advanced mathematical concepts is required.

#### Long(er) Version

8 years ago, I didn't care about investing, and I knew very little beyond what a Roth IRA was. I don't think I'd even heard of a "financial engineer". I think my disinterest at the time was primarily a hold over from the Great Recession and Bernie Madoff scandal, which were the major events occuring in the financial industry when I first started taking an interest in national and global issues. What changed me was my 401K. As part of my employment at CSpire, the company offered a 401K and an ESOP. The ESOP, I had no idea about, but I was faintly aware that the 401K was for retirement, since I had been intermittently funding a Roth IRA. So, I figured I should look into it, and that began my journey into investing.  

I quickly became interested beyond "figuring out my 401K", and started taking finance classes along with the part-time math program I was enrolled in at Mississippi College. Soon, I discovered the mysterious "financial engineer" and realized it was a perfect fit for my software development experience, math education and interest in investing.

### Personal Life

I live in Centereach with my wife (June), 2 year old son (Charles) and our cat (Prometheus) and dog (Coco). My wife and I moved here from Jackson, MS in August 2018, when I joined the quantitative finance program at Stony Brook University. In May 2020, I graduated from the program with an M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. Until October 2020, I worked part-time as an Intern at FQS Capital Partners and have been employed with Pinz Capital Management since then. 

Our lives are pretty typical for working parents of a 2 year old. I'm working full time, while my wife works part time. Outside of work, we take care of our son, who enjoys spending time at the local library and Chinese buffet (I didn't know a 2 year old could eat so much). June is a hobby artist, and we are both casual gamers, though she prefers Stardew Valley and phone apps while I'm a fan of real time strategy: Starcraft 2 and Age of Empires 2. Weather and time permitting, we walk around the neighborhood and talk with our neighbors. I keep up with politics, markets and economic matters, and while this isn't always great for my mental health, it is necessary to stay informed on local and world issues.

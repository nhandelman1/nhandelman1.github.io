### Career Goals




### Personal Life

Currently, my wife, June, and I are living in Centereach, NY with our two cats, Riffle and Prometheus. We moved here from Jackson, MS in August 2018, when I joined the quantitative finance program at Stony Brook University. In May 2020, I graduated from the program with an M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and have been working part-time at FQS Capital Partners since then. Additionally, I began work on a Python and MySQL personal project to improve my skills with them, along with PyQt5 GUI programming, data wrangling with financial data retrieved through IEX Cloud's API, and exploratory statistics and regression analysis with statsmodels and scipy. In the future, I plan on extending the project with time series analysis, modern machine learning techniques and an API to connect with a broker for automated trading.  
Due to Covid-19, we have been staying at home mostly, but with Long Island reopening, we were able to play a round of minigolf recently. June is a hobby artist, and we are both casual gamers, though she prefers Stardew Valley and phone apps while I'm a fan of real time strategy: Starcraft 2 and Age of Empires 2. Weather and time permitting, we walk around the neighborhood and to a nearby shopping center. I keep up with politics, markets and economic matters, and while this isn't always great for my mental health, it is necessary to stay informed on local and world issues.


I was born and raised in Jackson, MS, and spent my first 22 years there. I attended Beth Israel Preschool and then St. Andrew's Episcopal School through grade 12.

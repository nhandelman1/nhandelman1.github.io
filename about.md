### Career Goals

#### Short Version

I am seeking employment as a quantitative analyst, quantitative developer, quantitative trader, software engineer or related role at a firm in the investing, banking or wider financial industry. These roles all combine software development, mathematics, finance and a challenging environment into one package.  

#### Long(er) Version

6 years ago, I didn't care about investing, and I knew very little beyond what a Roth IRA was. I don't think I'd even heard of a "financial engineer". I think my disinterest at the time was primarily a hold over from the Great Recession and Bernie Madoff scandal, which were the major events occuring in the financial industry when I first started taking an interest in national and global issues. What changed me was my 401K. As part of my employment at CSpire, the company offered a 401K and an ESOP. The ESOP, I had no idea about, but I was faintly aware that the 401K was for retirement, since I had been intermittently funding a Roth IRA. So, I figured I should look into it, and that began my journey into investing.  

I quickly became interested beyond "figuring out my 401K", and started taking finance classes along with the part-time math program I was enrolled in at Mississippi College. Soon, I discovered the mysterious "financial engineer" and realized it was a perfect fit for my software development experience, math education and interest in investing.

### Personal Life

Currently, my wife, June, and I are living in Centereach, NY with our two cats, Riffle and Prometheus. We moved here from Jackson, MS in August 2018, when I joined the quantitative finance program at Stony Brook University. In May 2020, I graduated from the program with an M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and have been working part-time at FQS Capital Partners since then. Additionally, I began work on a Python and MySQL personal project to improve my skills with them, along with PyQt5 GUI programming, data wrangling with financial data retrieved through IEX Cloud's API, and exploratory statistics and regression analysis with statsmodels and scipy. In the future, I plan on extending the project with time series analysis, modern machine learning techniques and an API to connect with a broker for automated trading.  

Due to Covid-19, we have been staying at home mostly, but with Long Island reopening, we were able to play a round of minigolf recently. June is a hobby artist, and we are both casual gamers, though she prefers Stardew Valley and phone apps while I'm a fan of real time strategy: Starcraft 2 and Age of Empires 2. Weather and time permitting, we walk around the neighborhood and to a nearby shopping center. I keep up with politics, markets and economic matters, and while this isn't always great for my mental health, it is necessary to stay informed on local and world issues.

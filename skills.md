### Overview

On this page, I'll give (what I believe) to be an honest assessment of my software development and programming and mathematical skills. For each item, I'll describe my history with the item and what I think are my strengths and weaknesses. 

Two skills, common to all other skills and probably the most important of all, are the abilities to ask questions and to ask for help. Of course, you should always try to assess the nature of a problem or task, and determine what you do and don't know, before seeking external assistance. I'm an avid googler (as I'd hope all of my peers are). When asking for help, I keep in mind that others have their own tasks to manage, so I put in a good effort first.

### Software Development and Programming

In 2008 as a freshman at Millsaps College, I wrote my first program (Hello World, of course) in Java. Since then, I've been consistently programming in one language or another, either for work, school or personal projects. As listed below, I have experience, to differing extents, with a number of languages. While I do have preferences, I have yet to run into a language I would absolutely refuse to work with. Admittedly, PHP is my least favorite, and I have yet to see industrial scale COBOL software. 

#### Java

By far, I have the most experience with Java, having programmed with it almost consistently from 2008 to 2018, in industrial, academic, and personal environments. 


#### Python



#### Mathematica



#### Others

C++, VBA/Excel, PHP, COBOL, R, Matlab, Javascript, SQL, C#/.NET

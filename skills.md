### Overview

On this page, I'll give (what I believe) to be an honest assessment of my software development and programming and mathematical skills. For each item, I'll describe my history with the item and what I think are my strengths and weaknesses. 

Two skills, common to all other skills and probably the most important of all, are the abilities to ask questions and to ask for help. Of course, you should always try to assess the nature of a problem or task, and determine what you do and don't know, before seeking external assistance. I'm an avid googler (as I'd hope all of my peers are). When asking for help, I keep in mind that others have their own tasks to manage, so I put in a good effort first.

### Software Development and Programming

In 2008 as a freshman at Millsaps College, I wrote my first program (Hello World, of course) in Java. Since then, I've been consistently programming in one language or another, either for work, school or personal projects. As listed below, I have experience, to differing extents, with a number of languages. I have yet to run into a language I would absolutely refuse to work with. Admittedly, PHP is my least favorite, and I have yet to see industrial scale COBOL software. My favorites are Java and Python.

#### Software Development




#### Java

By far, I have the most experience with Java, having programmed with it almost consistently from 2008 to 2018, in industrial, academic, and personal environments, front and back end with infrastructure and customer facing applications. After a month or two of review of the language and frameworks and work with newer releases, I would be comfortable working in a mid-level position. 

Versions and frameworks: Java SE and EE (5,6,7), Spring, Google Web Toolkit, Apache Struts, Maven, JUnit, REST, SOAP

Strengths: 
* 10 years experience in industrial, academic, and personal environments
* Work in industry both front and back end and infrastructure and customer facing applications

Weaknesses: 
* 2 years out of practice
* little experience beyoned Java 7
* little experience with scientific, distributed and parallel computing

#### Python



#### Mathematica


#### SQL

#### C++ 

Through 2013, I was about as experienced with C++ as I was with Java, enough so that I taught it to students as an assistant. I've worked with it very little since then though. It is widely used in quantitative finance and would certainly be a great skill for me to have, but I decided to focus on Python.

#### Others

These are languages or software I've worked with in the past, but would consider my experience or current familiarity very much entry level at best.

* Matlab/Octave
* VBA/Excel
* R
* Javascript
* Minitab
* PHP
* COBOL

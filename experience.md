May 2019 - Present  
Full and Part Time Intern under [Dr. Michael Tiano](https://www.fqscapital.com/bio/michael-tiano_copy){:target="_blank"}

* FQS is a hedge fund that invests in other hedge funds, so we receive pitch decks, factsheets and other documents from funds and other sources. As we receive these documents, I update our system, perform a statistical evaluation on promising candidates and report any that meet certain requirements.  
* I am currently working on a Python REST API for connecting to financial data providers such as Alpha Vantage.
* For invested funds, the analysts each use Excel to report risk metrics. I completed a fully testable Mathematica application to replace the existing Excel risk monitors.   
* I build other Mathematica applications as requested by Dr. Tiano.

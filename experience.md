## Experience

### [FQS Capital Partners L.P.](https://www.fqscapital.com/index.htm#&panel1-1){:target="_blank"}

May 2019 - Present  
Full and Part Time Intern under [Dr. Michael Tiano](https://www.fqscapital.com/bio/michael-tiano_copy){:target="_blank"}

* FQS is a hedge fund that invests in other hedge funds, so we receive pitch decks, factsheets and other documents from funds and other sources. As we receive these documents, I update our system, perform a statistical evaluation on promising candidates and report any that meet certain requirements.  
* I am currently working on a Python REST API for connecting to financial data providers such as Alpha Vantage.
* For invested funds, the analysts each use Excel to report risk metrics. I completed a fully testable Mathematica application to replace the existing Excel risk monitors.   
* I build other Mathematica applications as requested by Dr. Tiano. 

### [Cspire Wireless Communications](http://www.cspire.com/){:target="_blank"}

September 2013 - June 2016  
Software Developer - Customer Applications Department

* I designed, implemented and maintained inventory control and point-of-sale software. The inventory control software was developed using [Apache Struts](http://struts.apache.org/){:target="_blank"} but was a mature project when I started at the company. I only performed minor work on this software. The point-of-sale software was a mostly mature [Google Web Toolkit](http://www.gwtproject.org/){:target="_blank"} project.  I spent the majority of my time working on this software, either fixing bugs or adding new functionality.
* Employees throughout the business use our software. Part of my job was to assist them if they had questions or needed help.
* At least once each year, I traveled to a retail store to see how the store representatives used our software. I also helped prepare new stores for opening.
* Programming languages, frameworks and other technology used: Java SE and EE (5, 6, 7), Javascript, CSS, HTML, Google Web Toolkit, Apache Struts, Maven, JUnit, Oracle, JSON, REST, SOAP, Jenkins CI

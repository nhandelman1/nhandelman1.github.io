## Experience

### [Cspire Wireless Communications](http://www.cspire.com/)

September 2013 - June 2016  
Software Developer - Customer Applications Department

* I designed, implemented and maintained inventory control and point-of-sale software. The inventory control software was developed using [Apache Struts](http://struts.apache.org/) but was a mature project when I started at the company. I only performed minor work on this software. The point-of-sale software was a mostly mature [Google Web Toolkit](http://www.gwtproject.org/) project.  I spent the majority of my time working on this software, either fixing bugs or adding new functionality.   
* Employees throughout the business use our software. Part of my job was to assist them if they had questions or needed help.   
* At least once each year, I traveled to a retail store to see how the store representatives used our software. I also helped prepare new stores for opening.
* Programming languages, frameworks and other technology used: Java SE and EE (5, 6, 7), Javascript, CSS, HTML, Google Web Toolkit, Apache Struts, Maven, JUnit, Oracle, JSON, REST, SOAP, Jenkins CI

### [Center for Advanced Computer Studies](https://computing.louisiana.edu/computer-sciences/center-advanced-computer-studies)

June 2012 - May 2013
Research and Teaching Assistant

* In Spring 2013, I worked under [Dr. Tony Maida](https://people.cmix.louisiana.edu/maida/)

## Overview

On this page, I'll give (what I believe) to be an honest assessment of my software development and programming skills. For each item, I'll describe my history with the item and what I think are my strengths and weaknesses. 

In 2008 as a freshman at Millsaps College, I wrote my first program (Hello World, of course) in Java. Since then, I've been consistently programming in one language or another, either for work, school or personal projects. As listed below, I have experience, to differing extents, with a number of languages. I have yet to run into a language I absolutely refuse to work with. Admittedly, PHP is my least favorite, and I have yet to see industrial scale COBOL software. My favorites are Java and Python.

Two skills, common to all other skills and probably the most important of all, are the abilities to ask questions and to ask for help. Of course, you should always try to assess the nature of a problem or task, and determine what you do and don't know, before seeking external assistance. I'm an avid googler (as I'd hope all of my peers are). When asking for help, I keep in mind that others have their own tasks to manage, so I put in a good effort first.

## Software Development




## Java

By far, I have the most experience with Java, having programmed with it almost consistently from 2008 to 2018, in industrial, academic, and personal environments, front and back end with infrastructure and customer facing applications. It isn't as widely used as Python in quantitative finance, so I have chosen to use Python over Java for recent school and personal projects. After a month or two of review of the language and frameworks and work with newer releases, I would be comfortable working in a mid-level position. 

Versions and technology: Java SE and EE (5,6,7), Spring, Google Web Toolkit, Apache Struts, Maven, JUnit, REST, SOAP

Strengths: 
* 10 years experience in industrial, academic, and personal environments
* Work in industry both front and back end and infrastructure and customer facing applications

Weaknesses: 
* 2 years out of practice
* Little experience beyond Java 7
* Little experience with scientific, distributed and parallel computing

## Python

I started with Python in Fall 2019 for a school project, and I've used it for a few school, work and personal projects since then. It has proven quite easy to learn. I did not use a formal tutorial to learn it though, so I'm still picking up on the "pythonic" coding style.

Versions and technology: Python (3.7 and 3.8), PyQt5, requests, numpy, pandas, statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib

Strengths:
  * Currently using Python for personal and work projects, so my mind is attuned to it.
  
Weaknesses:
  * 1 year experience and only small projects
  * Have not seen or worked with any large scale applications

## Wolfram Mathematica


## SQL



## C++ 

Through 2013, I was about as experienced with C++ as I was with Java, enough so that I taught it to students as an assistant. I've worked with it very little since then though. It is widely used in quantitative finance and would certainly be a great skill for me to have, but I decided to focus on Python.

## Others

These are languages or software I've studied or worked with in the past, but would consider my experience or current familiarity very much entry level at best.

* Matlab/Octave: Used on small numerical methods and probability distribution related projects within the past few years.
* R: Used on a few simple time series analysis projects for school in the past 2 years.
* MT5/MQL5: Worked on a forex trading project with a local trader from Oct 2018 - Nov 2018
* Excel: Fairly simple financial applications for school over the years. Worked with Excel Solver for Optimization. Honestly, never used a pivot table though.
* VBA/Access: In 2011, wrote a small VBA/Access project to mimic a checking account as a personal project.
* Minitab: One semester of statistical analysis in school, for uses ranging from one sample tests, to multiple regression and diagnostics, to non parametric methods.
* Javascript: Used partially in the MathFax project. It was also interspersed (much less than 1%) among the GWT Java software at CSpire. 
* PHP: Primary language of the MathFax project. I worked with it at the end of that project's development.
* COBOL: Studied for a few weeks during my Bachelor's degree out of personal interest.

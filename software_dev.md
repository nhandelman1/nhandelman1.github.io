## Overview

On this page, I'll give (what I believe) to be an honest assessment of my software development and programming skills. For each item, I'll describe my history with the item and what I think are my strengths and weaknesses. 

In 2008 as a freshman at Millsaps College, I wrote my first program (Hello World, of course) in Java. Since then, I've been consistently programming in one language or another, either for work, school or personal projects. As listed below, I have experience, to differing extents, with a number of languages. I have yet to run into a language I absolutely refuse to work with. Admittedly, PHP is my least favorite, and I have yet to see industrial scale COBOL software. My favorites are Java and Python.

Two skills, common to all other skills and probably the most important of all, are the abilities to ask questions and to ask for help. Of course, you should always try to assess the nature of a problem or task, and determine what you do and don't know, before seeking external assistance. I'm an avid googler (as I'd hope all of my peers are). When asking for help, I keep in mind that others have their own tasks to manage, so I put in a good effort first.

## Software Development

## Python

I started with Python in Fall 2019 for a school project, and it has been my language of choice since then. I typically program in an object oriented style. While it takes longer to get a first draft of a program, I find it is easier to expand, maintain and test code written in this style.  

Versions and technology: Python 3.6+, PyCharm IDE, PyQt5, requests, numpy, pandas, statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib, blpapi, mysql connector, openpyxl, paramiko, tabula, xlrd, smtplib, logging  

Strengths: 
  * Currently using Python for work and personal projects, so my mind is attuned to it 
  * Experience with big data and pandas, numpy and statsmodels 
  * Ready to be a individual and independent contributor to larger projects 
  
Weaknesses: 
  * Lack of experience with distributed, high performance and parallel computing 
  * Lack of experience with large scale applications 

## Java

I have the most experience with Java, though my experience is well out of date now. I programmed with it almost consistently from 2008 to 2018, in industrial, academic, and personal environments, front and back end with infrastructure and customer facing applications. Python is more common in quantitative finance, so I have chosen to use Python over Java for recent work, school and personal projects. 

Versions and technology: Java SE and EE (5,6,7), IntelliJ IDE, Spring, Google Web Toolkit, Apache Struts, Maven, JUnit, REST, SOAP, JavaFX, MySQL, Hibernate

Strengths: 
* 10 years experience in industrial, academic, and personal environments
* Work in industry both front and back end and infrastructure and customer facing applications

Weaknesses: 
* Years out of practice
* Little experience beyond Java 7
* Little experience with scientific, distributed and parallel computing

## R

In my current role, I maintain existing R code and add small features. These programs are all scripts that send reports through email.  

Versions and technology: 3.4+, RStudio IDE, DBI, dplyr, FactSet3, ggplot2, here, httr, mailR, openxlsx, plotly, Rblpapi, RDCOMClient, readxl, rmarkdown, xlsx

## C++ 

Through 2013, I was about as experienced with C++ as I was with Java, enough so that I taught it to students as an assistant. I've only used it on a few small class projects since then though. It is widely used in quantitative finance and would certainly be a great skill for me to have, but I've decided to focus on Python. Recently I've had exposure through work to C++, updating existing code and developing a small MFC application.  

## Wolfram Mathematica

Before coming to Stony Brook, I was aware of Wolfram Alpha but not Wolfram's underlying technology. So, I was a bit unprepared when Mathematica showed up in Dr. Frey's Foundations of Quantitative Finance class in Fall 2018. The learning curve was steep, but after working with it for 2 years through school and work at FQS, I've become comfortable with it. 

Versions and technology: Mathematica (11, 12), notebook, optimization, UI elements, financial computation, web scraping
 
## Others

These are languages or software I've studied or worked with in the past, but would consider my experience or current familiarity very much entry level at best.

* Matlab/Octave: Used on small numerical methods and probability distribution related projects within the past few years. 
* MT5/MQL5: Worked on a forex trading project with a local trader from Oct 2018 - Nov 2018 
* Excel: Fairly simple financial applications for school over the years. Worked with Excel Solver for Optimization. Honestly, never used a pivot table though. 
* VBA/Access: In 2011, wrote a small VBA/Access project to mimic a checking account as a personal project. 
* Minitab: One semester of statistical analysis in school, for uses ranging from one sample tests, to multiple regression and diagnostics, to non parametric methods. 
* Javascript: Used partially in the MathFax project. It was also interspersed (much less than 1%) among the GWT Java software at CSpire. 
* PHP: Primary language of the MathFax project. I worked with it at the end of that project's development. 
* COBOL: Studied for a few weeks during my Bachelor's degree out of personal interest.
